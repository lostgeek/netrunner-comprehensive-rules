  text: Faceup and Facedown Status
  rules:
  - rule: rule_rezzed_unrezzed
    text: |-
      An agenda, asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is {term:unrezzed} if it is installed and facedown. An asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is {term:rezzed} if it is installed and faceup. Runner cards, faceup agendas, operations, events, and counters are neither rezzed nor unrezzed.
      
  - subsection: sec_rez
    text: To {term:rez} an unrezzed card is to turn it faceup.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_rez_in_paw
      text: |-
        Some paid ability windows allow the Corp to rez assets and upgrades. See {ref:sec_paid_ability_windows}. The paid ability window at {ref:step_approach_paw} of a run allows the Corp to rez ice.
    - rule: rule_rez_by_ability
      text: Card abilities can direct or allow the Corp to rez cards at other times.
    - rule: rule_cannot_rez_agendas
      text: Agendas cannot be rezzed.
    - rule: rule_inherent_rez_cost
      text: |-
        Before rezzing a card, the Corp must pay that card's rez cost. This includes both rezzing in a paid ability window and rezzing through a card ability. Card abilities can modify or ignore rez costs, but must state this explicitly.
    - rule: rule_rez_procedure
      text: |-
        To resolve rezzing a card, the Corp pays its rez cost (accounting for any modifiers or additional costs), a checkpoint occurs (as required by {ref:rule_cost_paid_checkpoint}), then the Corp turns the card faceup. For purposes of meeting trigger conditions, the card is considered to be rezzed at the conclusion of this process.

  - subsection: sec_derez
    text: To {term:derez} a rezzed card is to turn it facedown.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_derez_by_ability
      text: Cards are only derezzed by card effects.
    - rule: rule_derez_cost
      text: There is no inherent cost associated with derezzing a card.
    - rule: rule_derez_procedure
      text: Derezzing a card is instantaneous and has no component steps.

  - subsection: sec_facedown_runner_cards
    text: Some abilities can install Runner cards facedown or turn already-installed Runner cards facedown.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_are_blank
      text: Installed Runner cards that are facedown do not have a name, type, or subtypes, and their abilities are not active.
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_are_distinct
      text: |-
        Facedown installed Runner cards are distinct. The origin of each such card (when and how it was installed facedown, or what faceup installed card was turned facedown) is open information.
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_flip_in_heap
      text: After a facedown Runner card enters the heap, it is turned faceup.
    - rule: rule_flip_is_not_uninstall
      text: A Runner card turned facedown is not considered to be uninstalled and simply remains in the play area.
    - rule: rule_unflipping_runner_cards
      text: |-
        If an installed facedown Runner card is turned faceup, the card gains its name, type, and subtypes, and it becomes active. Turning an installed facedown Runner card faceup does not meet the trigger conditions of "when installed" abilities.
    - rule: rule_runner_cards_neither_rezzed_nor_unrezzed
      text: Runner cards are never considered rezzed or unrezzed.

- section: sec_card_movements
  text: Card Movements
  rules:
  - subsection: sec_movement
    text: |-
      A {term:movement} is a way that cards change their zone or location following special rules. The movements are: arrange, draw, forfeit, install, play, search, score, steal, swap, and trash.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_non_movements
      text: |-
        Other terms that change the locations of cards are not movements. If an ability directs a player to "add" or "move" cards to 1 or more locations, simply put those cards in the indicated locations. If an ability or game rule directs a player to "discard", "set aside", or "remove from the game" 1 or more cards, simply put those cards in their owner's discard pile, the set-aside zone, or the removed-from-game zone, respectively.

  - subsection: sec_replacing_movements
    text: |-
      If a replacement effect modifies the effects of a movement, but does not replace the entire movement by name, the modified effect is still an occurrence of that movement and can still meet trigger conditions relating to that type of movement.
    examples:
    - text: |-
        {card:Harbinger}'s ability modifies the effects of trashing it by replacing adding {card:Harbinger} to the heap with turning it facedown. {card:Harbinger} is still trashed when the modified effect resolves. If this is the first time this turn that the Runner trashed one of their installed cards, they will be able to resolve {card:Wasteland}'s ability.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_cancelled_movement
      text: |-
        If a movement is replaced or prevented entirely or otherwise cannot be carried out, that movement does not take place and conditions related to that type of movement are not met.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          The Corp is resolving the first subroutine on {card:Rototurret} to trash an installed program. The Runner uses {card:Sacrificial Construct} to prevent the program from being trashed. Since trashing did not occur, the Runner does not place a power counter on {card:District 99}, and {card:District 99} can still meet its trigger condition if a program or piece of hardware is successfully trashed later in the turn.

  - rule: movement_arrange
    text: |-
      To {term:arrange} a set of cards is to reposition them among their current locations. The ful rules for arranging are detailed in {ref:sec_arrange}.
      
  - rule: movement_draw
    text: |-
      To {term:draw} a given number of cards is to move that many cards from the top of a player's deck to their hand. The full rules for drawing cards are detailed in {ref:sec_draw}.

  - rule: movement_forfeit
    text: |-
      To {term:forfeit} an agenda is to move it from a player's score area to the removed-from-game zone. When a player forfeits an agenda, its agenda points no longer contribute to that player's score, and any objects hosted on it are trashed.

  - rule: movement_install
    text: |-
      To {term:install} a card is to move it from its current zone to the play area. The full rules for installing cards are detailed in {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.

  - rule: movement_play
    text: |-
      To {term:play} an event or operation is to move it from its current zone to the play area, resolve its play abilities, and then trash it. The full rules for playing events and operations are detailed in {ref:sec_play}.

  - rule: movement_search
    text: |-
      To {term:search} is to look at a specified zone and potentially set aside cards from that zone. The full rules for searching are detailed in {ref:sec_search}.

  - rule: movement_score
    text: |-
      To {term:score} an agenda is to move it from its current zone to the Corp's score area. The full rules for scoring are detailed in {ref:sec_score_scoring_steal}.

  - rule: movement_steal
    text: |-
      To {term:steal} an agenda is to move it from its current zone to the Runner's score area. The full rules for stealing are detailed in {ref:sec_score_scoring_steal}.

  - rule: movement_swap
    text: |-
      To {term:swap} a pair of cards is to move each card to the other's location simultaneously. The full rules for swapping are detailed in {ref:sec_swap}.

  - rule: movement_trash
    text: |-
      To {term:trash} a card is to move it from its current zone to its ownerâ€™s discard pile. The full rules for trashing are detailed in {ref:sec_trashing}.
