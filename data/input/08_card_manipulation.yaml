  rules:
  - rule: rule_rezzed_unrezzed
    text: |-
      An agenda, asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is {term:unrezzed} if it is installed and facedown. An asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is {term:rezzed} if it is installed and faceup. Runner cards, faceup agendas, operations, events, and counters are neither rezzed nor unrezzed.
      
  - subsection: sec_rez
    text: To {term:rez} an unrezzed card is to turn it faceup.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_rez_in_paw
      text: |-
        Some paid ability windows allow the Corp to rez assets and upgrades. See {ref:sec_paid_ability_windows}. The paid ability window at {ref:step_approach_paw} of a run allows the Corp to rez ice.
    - rule: rule_rez_by_ability
      text: Card abilities can direct or allow the Corp to rez cards at other times.
    - rule: rule_cannot_rez_agendas
      text: Agendas cannot be rezzed.
    - rule: rule_inherent_rez_cost
      text: |-
        Before rezzing a card, the Corp must pay that card's rez cost. This includes both rezzing in a paid ability window and rezzing through a card ability. Card abilities can modify or ignore rez costs, but must state this explicitly.
    - rule: rule_rez_procedure
      text: |-
        To resolve rezzing a card, the Corp pays its rez cost (accounting for any modifiers or additional costs), a checkpoint occurs (as required by {ref:rule_cost_paid_checkpoint}), then the Corp turns the card faceup. For purposes of meeting trigger conditions, the card is considered to be rezzed at the conclusion of this process.

  - subsection: sec_derez
    text: To {term:derez} a rezzed card is to turn it facedown.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_derez_by_ability
      text: Cards are only derezzed by card effects.
    - rule: rule_derez_cost
      text: There is no inherent cost associated with derezzing a card.
    - rule: rule_derez_procedure
      text: Derezzing a card is instantaneous and has no component steps.

  - subsection: sec_facedown_runner_cards
    text: Some abilities can install Runner cards facedown or turn already-installed Runner cards facedown.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_are_blank
      text: Installed Runner cards that are facedown do not have a name, type, or subtypes, and their abilities are not active.
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_are_distinct
      text: |-
        Facedown installed Runner cards are distinct. The origin of each such card (when and how it was installed facedown, or what faceup installed card was turned facedown) is open information.
    - rule: rule_facedown_runner_cards_flip_in_heap
      text: After a facedown Runner card enters the heap, it is turned faceup.
    - rule: rule_flip_is_not_uninstall
      text: A Runner card turned facedown is not considered to be uninstalled and simply remains in the play area.
    - rule: rule_unflipping_runner_cards
      text: |-
        If an installed facedown Runner card is turned faceup, the card gains its name, type, and subtypes, and it becomes active. Turning an installed facedown Runner card faceup does not meet the trigger conditions of "when installed" abilities.
    - rule: rule_runner_cards_neither_rezzed_nor_unrezzed
      text: Runner cards are never considered rezzed or unrezzed.

      text: Choose and declare the install destination appropriate to the card that will be installed, including any host relationships, if applicable.
