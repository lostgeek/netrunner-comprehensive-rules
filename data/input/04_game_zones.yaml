    rules:
    - rule: rule_zone_types
      text: |-
        There are 8 zone types: deck, hand, discard pile, score area, play area, bank, set aside, and removed from the game.
    - rule: rule_player_zones
      text: Each player has their own deck, hand, discard pile, and score area. All players share the play area, the bank, the set-aside zone, and the removed-from-game zone.

      text: Each card in the game exists in exactly 1 zone at a time.

    rules:
    - rule: rule_reveal_from_hidden
      text: If a facedown card or a card in a hidden zone would ever move to another zone as part of an effect that requires that card to have a specific attribute, that card must be revealed before being moved to the new zone. If the card is being installed, this rule only applies as indicated by {ref:TODO}.
      examples:
      - text: When resolving {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}, the Corp chooses a facedown {card:Fast Break} in Archives. The Corp must reveal the {card:Fast Break} before adding it to HQ, to demonstrate that it is indeed an operation, meeting {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}'s requirement.
    - rule: rule_move_instantaneous
      text: When a card is moved from one zone to another, the move is instantaneous. The card is never in both zones at once, and it is never not in any zone at all.
  - rule: rule_outside_game
    text: A card that is not in any zone is outside the game. Cards outside of the game are distinct from cards in the removed-from-game zone, and cannot affect the game. They can only be affected by abilities that explicitly bring in extra cards from outside the game. See {ref:sec_extra_cards}.
