  text: General
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_zone
    text: A {term:zone} is a place in which cards and counters can exist during the game.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_zone_types
      text: |-
        There are 8 zone types: deck, hand, discard pile, score area, play area, bank, set aside, and removed from the game.
    - rule: rule_player_zones
      text: Each player has their own deck, hand, discard pile, and score area. All players share the play area, the bank, the set-aside zone, and the removed-from-game zone.
    - rule: rule_card_in_one_zone
      text: Each card in the game exists in exactly 1 zone at a time.
  - subsection: rule_move_between_zones
    text: Game rules and card effects can move cards and counters between zones. See {ref:sec_card_movements} for rules on card movements.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_reveal_from_hidden
      text: If a facedown card or a card in a hidden zone would ever move to another zone as part of an effect that requires that card to have a specific attribute, that card must be revealed before being moved to the new zone. If the card is being installed, this rule only applies as indicated by {ref:TODO}.
      examples:
      - text: When resolving {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}, the Corp chooses a facedown {card:Fast Break} in Archives. The Corp must reveal the {card:Fast Break} before adding it to HQ, to demonstrate that it is indeed an operation, meeting {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}'s requirement.
    - rule: rule_move_instantaneous
      text: When a card is moved from one zone to another, the move is instantaneous. The card is never in both zones at once, and it is never not in any zone at all.
  - rule: rule_outside_game
    text: A card that is not in any zone is outside the game. Cards outside of the game are distinct from cards in the removed-from-game zone, and cannot affect the game. They can only be affected by abilities that explicitly bring in extra cards from outside the game. See {ref:sec_extra_cards}.
  - rule: rule_public_zone
    text: A {term:public} zone is one where cards are freely visible to both players unless they are facedown. The play area, the bank, the set-aside zone, the removed-from-game zone, and both players' score areas and discard piles are public zones. See {ref:sec_card_visibility} for rules on card visibility and {ref:sec_faceup_facedown_status} for rules on the faceup and facedown status of a card.
  - rule: rule_hidden_zone
    text: A {term:hidden} zone is one where cards are not visible to either player. Each player's deck is a hidden zone.
  - rule: rule_secret_zone
    text: A {term:secret} zone is one where cards are visible only to their controller. Each player's hand is a secret zone.
  - subsection: rule_location
    text: A {term:location} is a specific position within a zone that an object can occupy. A DESTINATION is a location to which an object is to be moved.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_deck_location
      text: A card in a player's deck has a location identified by how many cards it is from the top of that deck.
    - rule: rule_play_area_location
      text: Some objects in the play area are in specific locations. See {ref:TODO}.
    - rule: rule_hosted_object_location
      text: The location of a hosted object is its host card.
    - rule: rule_default_location
      text: All other objects are simply located in their zone and do not have a more specific location.

- section: sec_deck
  text: Deck
  rules:
  - rule: rule_draw_deck
    text: When the game begins, each player's deck presented during setup becomes their in-game draw deck.
  - rule: rule_deck_hidden
    text: Decks must be kept facedown with their cards hidden from both players. Neither player may look at the cards in any deck without being explicitly directed to do so by a rule or card ability.
  - subsection: rule_deck_ordered
    text: Decks are ordered. The location of each card in a deck must be maintained except when a player is explicitly directed to manipulate the cards in a deck by a rule or card ability. See {ref:rule_deck_location}.
    rules:
      - rule: rule_deck_order_while_searching
        text: While searching a deck, a player is not required to maintain the order of the searched cards or indicate the previous location of any card found by the search. Note that the deck is always shuffled upon completion of the search, as required by {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_deck_size_open_information
    text: The number of cards in a deck is open information. Any player may count the number of cards in a deck at any time.
  - rule: rule_deck_inactive
    text: Cards in a deck are inactive.
  - rule: rule_deck_name
    text: Each player's deck has its own name as a means of differentiating between the two.

    rules:
    - rule: rule_rnd_name
      text: R&D is the name for the Corp's deck. It is also one of the Corp's central servers. See {ref:TODO}.
    - rule: rule_rnd_empty_rnd
      text: If the Corp must ever draw from R&D while it is empty, the Runner wins the game. See {ref:sec_ending_the_game}.
