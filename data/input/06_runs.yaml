      A {term:run} is a Runner's attack on a server. There are 6 phases used in the procedure of carrying out a run, described in {ref/through:sec_run_initiation,sec_run_ends_phase}. A run always begins with the Initiation Phase. {ref:Sec_steps_of_a_run} contains the full set of steps carried out during each phase, and should be referred to in conjunction with the sections discussing the phases.

        The Initiation Phase is complete. If the attacked server has at least one piece of ice protecting it, proceed to {ref:rule_sec_run_approach_ice_phase}, Approach Ice Phase, approaching the outermost piece of ice protecting the attacked server. If the attacked server is not protected by ice, proceed to {ref:rule_sec_run_movement_phase}, Movement Phase.
