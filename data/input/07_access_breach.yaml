  text: Accessing Cards
  rules: 
  - rule: rule_accessing
    text: {term:accessing} is the process of the Corp showing one of their cards to the Runner for potential interaction.
  - rule: rule_accessing_who_can_look
    text: While the Runner is accessing a card, the Runner is allowed to look at that card, even if it would normally not be visible to them. While the Runner is accessing a card, the Corp is allowed to look at it as well, except when the card is being accessed from R&D.
  - rule: rule_accessing_trigger_condition
    text: An ability that meets its trigger condition when its source card is accessed is active even if the source card is inactive. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_mid_access_ability
    text: During each access, the Runner has 1 opportunity to use a mid-access ability. This occurs after the reaction window at the beginning of the access, and before the Runner steals an accessed agenda.
  - subsection: rule_basic_trash_ability
    text: The Runner always has the ability "Access â†’ Pay the trash cost of the accessed card: Trash it." This is the {term:basic trash ability}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_paying_trash_costs
      text: All assets and upgrades have trash costs, as do some ice and operations. If a card does not have a trash cost, the Runner cannot pay its trash cost, and therefore the Runner cannot use the basic trash ability during that access.
    - rule: rule_trash_in_archives
      text: The Runner cannot trash or pay the trash cost of a card in the Corp's discard pile, either with the basic trash ability or with other mid-access abilities.
    - rule: rule_access_installed_must_trash_if_able
      text: One card, {card:Mumbad Virtual Tour}, has the ability "If the Runner accesses this upgrade while it is installed, they must trash it, if able." When this ability applies, the Runner can use any mid-access ability they have available that trashes the card, but they cannot decline to use a mid-access ability or use one that would not trash the accessed card unless they are unable to pay the cost of any ability that would trash it.
    - rule: rule_access_reveal_trash_if_able
      text: One card, {card:Neutralize All Threats}, has the ability "The first time each turn you access a card with a trash cost, reveal it. You must trash that card by paying its trash cost, if able." When this ability applies, the Runner can only use the basic trash ability. They cannot decline to use a mid-access ability or use a mid-access ability available from a card unless they cannot pay the cost of the basic trash ability.
  - subsection: rule_after_mid_access_agenda
    text: If, after resolving mid-access abilities, the Runner is still accessing an agenda, they must steal it.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_agenda_additional_cost
      text: Some abilities can create additional costs to steal an agenda. The Runner can decline to pay such costs and not steal the agenda. See {ref:rule_additional_cost}.
  - rule: rule_moved_while_accessing
    text: If a card moves to another location while it is being accessed, the access ends immediately.
