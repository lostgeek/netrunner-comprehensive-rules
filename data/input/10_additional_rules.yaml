      Some cards are {term:unique}, and have a unique symbol ([uniqsym]) before their name to designate this. There can be only one unique card of the same name active at a time. If a unique card becomes active, any other card that shares its name is trashed during the next checkpoint. Trashing a card this way cannot be prevented. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.
  - rule: sec_old_self_reference_rules
    text: Some cards are written with self-referential language. If a card references its own name without using the word "copy", treat that name as if it said "this object".

    The Runner's link is the number of points their path through the Net traverses between their rig and the Corp's server. The more proxies, redirects, and other intermediary connecting points between the Corp and the Runner, the harder it is for sysops to track down the Runner's virtual location.
