  rules:
  - rule: rule_uniqueness
    text: |-
      Some cards are {term:unique}, and have a unique symbol ([uniqsym]) before their name to designate this. There can be only one unique card of the same name active at a time. If a unique card becomes active, any other card that shares its name is trashed during the next checkpoint. Trashing a card this way cannot be prevented. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.
  - subsection: rule_purge
    text: |-
      To {term:purge virus counters} is to remove all virus counters hosted on cards and return them to the bank. The Corp can purge virus counters as a basic action or with a card ability.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_purge_ncigs
      text: |-
        The Corp can always use a purge effect, even if there are no virus counters currently hosted on any cards. This is an exception to {ref:rule_ncigs}.
  - rule: rule_add_card_to_score_area
    text: |-
      Some abilities add a card to a player's score area "as an agenda". When this happens, the card loses all its previous properties and gains only those properties specified in the effect converting it. This conversion lasts until the card moves to a zone that is not a score area, at which point it returns to being its original printed card. If this happens in any way other than by agenda forfeit, the card is immediately trashed. See {ref:rule_forfeit_agenda}.
  - rule: rule_card_to_counter
    text: |-
      Some abilities can convert a card into a counter. When this happens, the card loses all its previous properties and gains only those properties specified in the effect converting it. This conversion lasts until the counter moves to another zone, at which point it reverts to being a card, regains its original printed characteristics, and is trashed.
  - rule: sec_old_self_reference_rules
    text: Some cards are written with self-referential language. If a card references its own name without using the word "copy", treat that name as if it said "this object".

  snippet: |-
    The Runner's link is the number of points their path through the Net traverses between their rig and the Corp's server. The more proxies, redirects, and other intermediary connecting points between the Corp and the Runner, the harder it is for sysops to track down the Runner's virtual location.
