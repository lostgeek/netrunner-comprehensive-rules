  - subsection: rule_identity_play_area
    text: Each player starts the game with a single identity active in the play area. See {ref:sec_starting_the_game}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_identity_double_sided
      text: |-
        Some identities are double-sided. Only the front side of a double-sided identity will have values for its minimum deck size and influence limit. Only the side of a double-sided identity that is currently faceup is active at any given time.
    - rule: rule_identity_not_installed 
      text: Identities are not installed.
  - rule: rule_identity_deck_size_influence
    text: |-
      Only identity cards have minimum deck sizes and influence limits. These values do not apply during the game; instead, they determine deckbuilding constraints for decks associated with that identity. See {ref:sec_deck_construction}.
  - rule: rule_identity_base_link
    text: Only Runner identities have a base link. This value is used in calculating the Runner's link value. See {ref:sec_link}.
