text: Card Types
sections:
- section: sec_identities
  text: Identities
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_identity_play_area
    text: Each player starts the game with a single identity active in the play area. See {ref:sec_starting_the_game}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_identity_double_sided
      text: |-
        Some identities are double-sided. Only the front side of a double-sided identity will have values for its minimum deck size and influence limit. Only the side of a double-sided identity that is currently faceup is active at any given time.
    - rule: rule_identity_not_installed 
      text: Identities are not installed.
  - rule: rule_identity_deck_size_influence
    text: |-
      Only identity cards have minimum deck sizes and influence limits. These values do not apply during the game; instead, they determine deckbuilding constraints for decks associated with that identity. See {ref:sec_deck_construction}.
  - rule: rule_identity_base_link
    text: Only Runner identities have a base link. This value is used in calculating the Runner's link value. See {ref:sec_link}.
  - rule: rule_identity_HQ
    text: The Corp's identity card is used to mark the location of HQ. See {ref:TODO}.

- section: sec_agendas
  text: Agendas
  snippet: Agendas represent valuable pieces of Corporate data. When the Corp advances and scores agendas, it represents completion of critical Corporate projects. When the Runner steals agendas, it represents their acquisition of secret Corporate data.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_agendas_in_roots
    text: The Corp may install agendas only in the roots of remote servers. There can be only one agenda or one asset installed in the root of any given remote server at a time. See {ref:TODO}.
  - subsection: rule_agenda_advancement_requirement_agenda_points
    text: Only agendas have advancement requirements and agenda points. See {ref:sec_score_scoring_steal}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_agenda_advancement_requirement
      text: An agenda's advancement requirement is the minimum number of advancement counters that must be on that agenda for the Corp to score it.
    - rule: rule_score_from_score_area
      text: The agenda points on an agenda contribute to a player's score while the agenda is in their score area.
  - subsection: rule_agendas_not_rezzed
    text: Agendas cannot be rezzed and are inactive while installed. Agendas are active in the Corp's score area. Agendas are inactive in the Runner's score area unless the agenda's card text specifies otherwise. See {ref:TODO}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_agendas_faceup
      text: Some agendas may be installed faceup or turned faceup through card abilities. Faceup agendas are neither rezzed nor unrezzed. If an agenda's printed text directs the Corp to install it faceup, that agenda's abilities are active while it is installed.
    - rule: rule_advancemenet_requirements_modification
      text: Some agendas modify the requirements for stealing or scoring them. These abilities are always active, according to any restrictions or requirements specified. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_agendas_advanced
    text: Agendas can always be advanced. See {ref:sec_advancing_cards}.

- section: sec_assets
  text: Assets
  snippet: Assets represent various resources and connections at the Corp's disposal.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_asset_root_remote
    text: The Corp may install assets only in the roots of remote servers. There can be only one agenda or one asset installed in the root of any given remote server at a time. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_asset_rez_cost
    text: Assets are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs during a paid ability window. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_asset_trash_cost
    text: Assets are among the card types that have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an asset, they may pay the trash cost to trash that asset. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_asset_lady_liberty
    text: One asset, {card:Lady Liberty}, has the subtype {subtype:region} and the text "Limit 1 {subtype:region} per server." See {ref:TODO} for rules governing {subtype:region} cards.

- section: sec_ice
  text: Ice
  snippet: Ice are sophisticated security systems that protect Corporate servers through a variety of means. "Ice" has been suggested to stand for a variety of expressions, but is most commonly expanded as "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics".
  rules:
  - rule: rule_ice_piece_of_ice
    text: |-
      "Ice" and "piece of ice" are synonymous.
  - subsection: rule_ice_protect_server
    text: Ice are the only type of card installed protecting servers. Ice are not installed in the roots of servers. See {ref:TODO}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_layout
      text: Ice protecting a server are laid out horizontally in front of that server, with the outermost piece of ice furthest from the server.
    - rule: rule_ice_instal_outermost
      text: When the Corp installs a piece of ice, they must install it in the outermost position protecting a server. See {ref:TODO}.
  - subsection: rule_ice_rez_cost
    text: Ice are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs. See {ref:TODO}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_rez_window
      text: Unlike assets and upgrades, ice can normally only be rezzed while being approached during a run. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_ice_strength_value
    text: Ice are among the card types that have strength. An ice's strength determines which icebreakers are allowed to interface with it. See {ref:TODO}.
  - subsection: rule_ice_trash_cost
    text: Some ice have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an ice with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that ice. See {ref:TODO}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_access
      text: Unlike assets, upgrades, and agendas, ice are not normally accessed while installed. Encountering a piece of ice does not entail accessing that ice and does not give the Runner an opportunity to pay its trash cost.
  - rule: rule_ice_install_cost
    text: Ice are the only Corp cards with install costs. The install cost of a piece of ice is not a printed value but instead a calculated value based on the number of other ice already protecting the relevant server. See {ref:rule_install_cost_ice}.
  - rule: rule_ice_subroutine
    text: Ice are the only cards with subroutines. See {ref:TODO}.

- section: sec_operations
  text: Operations
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_operation_play
    text: Operations are the only Corp cards that are played. Operations are never installed. Playing an operation causes its abilities to become active, and once those abilities are fully resolved the operation is trashed. See {ref:TODO}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_operation_condition
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:condition}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:condition} operations convert themselves into {subtype:condition} counters and install themselves. A {subtype:condition} operation cannot be installed by an install effect; it can only be installed through its own conversion ability. See {ref:TODO}.
    - rule: rule_operation_current
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:current}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:current} operations prevent themselves from being trashed until another {subtype:current} operation or event is played or the Runner steals an agenda. When one of these occurs, the active {subtype:current} is trashed during the next checkpoint. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.
    - rule: rule_operation_lockdown
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:lockdown}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:lockdown} operations prevent themselves from being trashed until the start of the Corp's next turn after the operation is played. Once the Corp's turn begins, this effect expires and the operation is trashed during the next checkpoint, before any conditional abilities marked pending at that time can be triggered. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.
  - rule: rule_operation_play_cost
    text: Operations are the only Corp cards with play costs. An operation's play cost is the number of credits the Corp must spend to play the operation. See {ref:TODO}.
  - rule: rule_operation_play_cost
    text: Some operations have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an operation with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that operation. See {ref:TODO}.
