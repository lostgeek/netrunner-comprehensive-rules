      The identifier of a card is its {term:name}, alternatively referred to as its title. It is written along the top of the card for identities, agendas, ice, operations, events, and resources, or immediately below the art box in the case of assets, upgrades, hardware, and programs.
  - rule: rule_identity_subtitles
    text: Identities have a subtitle written immediately below the main title line. Their full name is the combination of their main title and subtitle.
  - rule: rule_self_reference

      The play, install, or rez cost of a card is a number that appears in the top-left corner of most card types. Play and install costs appear within a large circular icon, while rez costs appear within a small octagonal icon.
  - rule: rule_paying_printed_costs
