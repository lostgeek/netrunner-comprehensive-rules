    These rules are compatible with cards from the game {term:android: netrunner} by Fantasy Flight Games. {term:android: netrunner} is a game about the cyber-struggle between massive Corporations and subversive hackers known as Runners.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_player_definitions
    text: |-
      The game is played between two players. One player takes the role of the Corp (Corporation) and the other takes the role of the Runner. This rules document will frequently refer to a player interchangeably with their game role.
  - rule: rule_requirements
    text: |-
      Each player needs a legal deck, an identity card for their role, and any extra cards used from outside their deck. They also need a supply of tokens as described in {ref:sec_counters_and_tokens}. The constraints that define the legality of a deck are defined in {ref:sec_deck_construction}, and the cases where cards outside the deck and identity can be used are defined in {ref:sec_extra_cards}.
- section: sec_golden_rules
  text: Golden Rules
  rules:
  - rule: rule_card_precedence
    text: If the text of a card directly contradicts these rules, the text of the card takes precedence.
  - subsection: rule_cannot_precedence
    text: If a rule or ability directs something to happen, but another effect states that it cannot happen, the "cannot" ability takes precedence.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_cannot_ncigs
      text: If a "cannot" effect prohibits all of the effects of another ability, that ability cannot be triggered.
    - rule: rule_partially_cannot
      text: If a "cannot" effect prohibits only part of another ability, that ability can be triggered, but the prohibited steps of resolving that ability are not carried out.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          During a run, {card:Lockdown}'s subroutine resolves, preventing the Runner from drawing cards for the remainder of the turn. The Runner has a {card:Diesel} and a {card:Process Automation} in their grip. For the remainder of this turn, they cannot play {card:Diesel} as its entire ability is prohibited, but they can play {card:Process Automation}. Even though cards cannot be drawn through {card:Process Automation}, the Runner can play it to gain 2[c].
  - rule: rule_if_able
    text: If an instruction includes the words "if able," it can only be carried out fully or not at all. If any part of the instruction is not possible to carry out, the entire instruction is ignored.
  - rule: rule_do_as_much_as_you_can
    text: If an instruction does not include the words "if able," as much of that instruction as possible is carried out. Any parts of the instruction that are not possible to carry out are ignored.
  - rule: rule_ncigs
    text: A player can only take an action or use an ability if its effect has the potential to change the game state. This potential is assessed strictly by what the action or ability can be expected to accomplish, without regard to the consequences of paying any costs to initiate that action or ability and without regard to any other abilities that may meet their conditions in the process of initiating or resolving that action or ability.
    examples:
    - text: |-
        The Corp has one unrezzed piece of ice installed and {card:Liquidation} in HQ. As {card:Liquidation} requires the Corp to have at least one rezzed card to trash, the Corp cannot play {card:Liquidation} as it cannot change the game state.
    - text: |-
        The Corp has one rezzed piece of ice installed and {card:Liquidation} in HQ. Because the Corp has at least one rezzed card that could be trashed (which would change the game state), they can play {card:Liquidation}, spending a click and paying its play cost. The Corp then chooses any number of their rezzed cards to trash, which could be zero cards.
    - text: |-
        The Runner is playing {card:Armand "Geist" Walker} and has {card:Forger} installed. The Runner can only trash {card:Forger} and trigger {card:Geist}'s ability when they are about to take a tag (which {card:Forger} could avoid) or while they have a tag (which {card:Forger} could remove). Using {card:Forger} at any other time has no potential to change the game state.

- section: sec_symbols
  text: Symbols
  rules:
  - rule: rule_symbols
    text: Several non-English symbols appear on cards and in this rules document. This section serves as a basic guide to those symbols.
  - rule: rule_plaintext_symbolds
    text: When this document is presented in a format without images, plaintext replacements are used. These replacements are listed along with the symbols themselves for reference.
  - rule: rule_symbol_credits
    text: |-
      The symbol [c] (plaintext: [c]) stands for "credit". It always appears with a numeral, such as 1[c], which means "one credit," or 3[c], which means "three credits." See {ref:sec_credits} for rules about credits.
  - rule: rule_symbol_clicks
    text: |-
      The symbol [click] (plaintext: [click]) stands for "click". Multiple clicks can be represented either by multiple symbols, such as [click][click], or by a numeral and symbol, such as 2[click], both meaning "two clicks." See {ref:sec_clicks} for rules about clicks.
  - rule: rule_symbol_recurring
    text: |-
      The symbol [recurring] (plaintext: [recurring]) stands for recurring credit. It always appears with a numeral, such as 1[recurring], which means "one recurring credit," or 3[recurring], which means "three recurring credits." See {ref:rule_sec_recurring} for rules about recurring credits.
  - rule: rule_symbol_link
    text: |-
      The symbol [link] (plaintext: [link]) stands for "link". It is always used with a quantity, such as 1[link], which means "1 link." See {ref:sec_link} for rules about link.
  - rule: rule_symbol_mu
    text: |-
      The symbol [MU] (plaintext: [MU]) stands for "memory unit". It always appears with a quantity, such as 2[MU], which means "2 memory units." See {ref:sec_memory} for rules about memory.
  - rule: rule_symbol_sub
    text: |-

  - rule: rule_symbol_trash
    text: |-
      The symbol [trash] (plaintext: [trash]) stands for "trash this card". It is used as a self-referential cost in card text, such as "[trash]: Draw 2 cards," which means "Trash this card to draw 2 cards." See {ref:sec_costs} for rules about costs, and {ref:sec_trashing} for rules about trashing cards.
  - rule: rule_symbol_interrupt
    text: |-
      The symbol [interrupt] (plaintext: [interrupt]) stands for "interrupt timing". It is used to designate abilities that resolve immediately before other abilities. See {ref:sec_interrupts_replacements} for rules about interrupt abilities.

- section: sec_deck_construction
  text: Deck Construction
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_identity
    text: |-
      Each player's deck is associated with a single identity card that determines the faction, minimum deck size, and influence limit of that deck. The identity card may also stipulate other variances from the standard deckbuilding rules.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_gateway_identities
      text: |-
        The identities {card:The Catalyst} and {card:The Syndicate} from the {product:System Gateway Starter Pack} are intended for use only with the decks included in that pack. They are not legal for play under the full deck construction rules.
  - rule: rule_legal_deck
    text: Each deck must meet all requirements in this section to be legal for play.
  - subsection: rule_minimum_deck_size
    text: The deck must contain at least as many cards as the minimum deck size indicated on the corresponding identity.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_outside_the_deck
      text: |-
        Identity cards, extra cards that begin the game outside the deck, and player aid cards are not part of the deck and are not counted towards the size of the deck.
    - rule: rule_maximum_deck_size
      text: There is no maximum deck size.
  - rule: rule_disallowed_cards
    text: Decks cannot contain identity cards, player aid cards, cards from the wrong side (Corp cards in a Runner deck or vice-versa), or out-of-faction cards that lack influence costs.
  - subsection: rule_influence_limit
    text: |-
      Neutral cards and cards that belong to a faction other than the corresponding identity's faction are all considered out-of-faction. The total influence cost of out-of-faction cards in the deck must not exceed the influence limit of that identity.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_influence_by_copy
      text: The total influence cost of out-of-faction cards is counted by copy and not by name.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          Including a single copy of {card:Diesel} in a non-Shaper deck adds 2 to the total influence in that deck, while including two copies of {card:Diesel} in a non-Shaper deck adds 4 to the total influence in that deck.
  - subsection: rule_agenda_points
    text: A Corp deck must contain agendas totalling a certain number of agenda points, as determined by the total number of cards in the deck.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_40_44
      text: A deck with 40 to 44 cards must contain 18 or 19 agenda points.
    - rule: rule_45_49
      text: A deck with 45 to 49 cards must contain 20 or 21 agenda points.
    - rule: rule_50_54
      text: A deck with 50 to 54 cards must contain 22 or 23 agenda points.
    - rule: rule_54+
      text: A deck with more than 54 cards must contain 22 or 23 agenda points, plus an additional 2 agenda points for every full 5 cards in the deck over 50.
      examples:
      - text: A 66 card deck requires 6 additional agenda points, since it includes 3 sets of 5 cards beyond 50. This gives a final requirement of either 28 or 29 agenda points.
  - rule: rule_maximum_copies
    text: The deck cannot contain more than 3 copies of any single card, by name. Some cards stipulate alternative copy limits in their card text.
  - rule: rule_special_tournament_rules
    text: Tournament play may impose other restrictions or requirements on the legal configurations of identities and decks. 

- section: sec_extra_cards
  text: Extra Cards
  rules:
  - rule: rule_outside_deck
    text: Some abilities allow for the use of additional cards from outside the deck.
  - subsection: rule_jinteki_biotech
    text: |-
      One Corp identity, {card:Jinteki Biotech: Life Imagined}, has the ability, "Before taking your first turn, you may switch this card with any copy of Jinteki Biotech." There are 3 versions of this identity, which have different abilities on their reverse side.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_jinteki_biotech_detail
      text: |-
        A player playing Jinteki Biotech as their identity may bring any number of copies of that identity along with their deck. After completing game setup, that player may choose any copy they own to be their active identity for the duration of the game. All other copies are placed outside the game.
  - subsection: rule_adam
    text: |-
      One Runner identity, {card:Adam: Compulsive Hacker}, has the ability, "You start the game with 3 different {subtype:directive} cards installed (these cards are not considered part of your deck)."
    rules:
    - rule: rule_adam_different_directives
      text: |-
        A player playing Adam as their identity must bring at least 3 differently named cards with the {subtype:directive} subtype along with their deck. The player may bring any number of {subtype:directive} cards over the required 3.
    - rule: rule_adam_directives_install
      text: |-
        After players reveal their identities, the player playing Adam selects exactly 3 of their provided {subtype:directive} cards. Those cards begin the game installed in the play area. All other {subtype:directives} the player brought this way remain outside the game.
    - rule: rule_adam_directives_deck
      text: |-
        A player playing Adam can also include {subtype:directives} cards in their deck. The cards chosen to be installed at the beginning of the game do not impact the deck's influence requirements or the maximum allowed number of copies of those cards.
    - rule: rule_adam_directives_during_game
      text: |-
        Once the game has begun, the cards installed this way are treated exactly as any other installed cards. Abilities that move these cards to other zones function normally, including shuffling them into the stack.
  - subsection: rule_additional_identity
    text: |-
      Two cards, {card:Rebirth} and {card:DJ Fenris}, make use of identity cards other than the one selected by the player during deck construction.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_additional_identities_pile
      text: |-
        A player may bring any number of additional Runner identity cards along with their deck. These cards are kept in a pile outside the game. The Runner may look at these cards at any time.
    - rule: rule_additional_identities_reference
      text: |-
        When an ability refers to an identity other than the Runner's current identity, it refers to the cards provided this way. If an identity card leaves the play area, it must be returned to the pile outside the game.
    - rule: rule_legal_additional_identities
      text: |-
        In a tournament, all identities brought to the game this way must be legal for players to use as their actual identity in that tournament.
    - rule: rule_additional_identity_double_sided
      text: |-
        One Runner identity, {card:Hoshiko Shiro}, is double-sided (see {ref:sec_identities}). If the Runner switches their identity with Hoshiko, it enters play with the front side faceup. If the Runner switches Hoshiko with another identity, the new identity enters play faceup regardless of Hoshiko's current status.

- section: sec_starting_the_game
  text: Starting the Game
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_player_roles
    text: |-
      The players decide who will play as the Corp and who will play as the Runner. Each player places an appropriate identity card for the side they are to play faceup in the play area, then supplies a corresponding deck, placing it facedown in the play area, and any appropriate extra cards.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_setup_identity
      text: Some identity cards have abilities that affect setup. Even though cards are not active until the game begins, these identities still alter setup at the appropriate step as indicated by their text.
    - rule: rule_double_sided_identity
      text: Some identities are double-sided (see {ref:sec_identities}). If a player is playing a double-sided identity, it begins the game with the front side faceup.
  - rule: rule_setup_abilities
    text: |-
      If a player's identity has an ability that affects setup or the start of the game, and that ability does not directly correspond to a setup step outlined in this section of the rules, that player makes any necessary decisions and changes for their identity's special setup or start of game abilities at this time. If both players have setup or start of game abilities at this time, the Corp resolves theirs first.
  - rule: rule_start_tokens
    text: |-
      The players create the bank by gathering all types of tokens described in {ref:sec_counters_and_tokens}.
  - rule: rule_start_credits
    text: Each player takes five credits from the bank, placing the credits in their credit pool.
  - rule: rule_start_shuffle
    text: Each player shuffles their deck.
  - subsection: rule_start_hand
    text: Each player draws 5 cards from the top of their deck to form their starting hand.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_mulligan
      text: After drawing starting hands, the Corp may choose to take a mulligan; then, the Runner may choose to take a mulligan. To take a mulligan, the player shuffles their starting hand back into their deck, then draws a new starting hand. They must keep the second hand as their starting hand.
  - subsection: rule_start_corp_turn
    text: The game begins and the Corp takes their first turn.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_before_first_turn
      text: If the Corp's identity has an ability with instructions for "before taking your first turn," the Corp resolves that ability immediately before taking their first turn, and thus before the game starts.

- section: sec_ending_the_game
  text: Ending the Game
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_game_end
    text: The game ends when a player meets one of their win conditions.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_simultaneous_win
      text: If both players would simultaneously satisfy their win conditions, the game ends in a draw.
  - subsection: rule_win_conditions
    text: Each player has two possible win conditions available.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_win_agenda_points
      text: |-
        Either player can win by collecting agenda points in their score area (usually done by scoring or stealing agendas; see {ref:sec_score_steal}). A player with a score of 7 or more wins the game.
    - rule: rule_flatline
      text: |-
        The Corp wins if the Runner is flatlined. The Runner is flatlined immediately if they suffer more damage than they have cards in their grip. The Runner is also flatlined if, at the beginning of their discard phase, their maximum hand size is less than 0. See {ref:sec_damage} for more information about damage.
    - rule: rule_empty_rnd
      text: |-
        The Runner wins if the Corp is required to draw a card from R&D but cannot because R&D is empty.

- section: sec_cards
  text: Cards
  rules:
  - rule: rule_corp_card_types
    text: |-
      There are six types of Corp cards: agendas, assets, ice, identities, operations, and upgrades. All cards except the identity card are shuffled into the Corp's deck at the beginning of the game.
  - rule: rule_runner_card_types
    text: |-
      There are five types of Runner cards: events, hardware, identities, programs, and resources. All cards except the identity card are shuffled into the Runner's deck at the beginning of the game.
  - subsection: rule_active_cards
    text: Cards that are {term:active} are able to affect the game through their abilities.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_default_active_card_locations
      text: |-
        Runner cards that are installed and faceup in the play area, Corp cards that are installed and rezzed, events and operations in the play area, agendas in the Corp's score area, and both players' identities are active.
    - rule: rule_runner_become_active
      text: |-
        Unless otherwise stated, Runner cards become active as part of the process of playing or installing them.
    - rule: rule_corp_become_active
      text: |-
        Unless otherwise stated, Corp cards other than operations are installed unrezzed, and thus inactive, into the play area. Assets, ice, and upgrades become active when they are rezzed; agendas become active when they are scored. Operations become active as part of the process of playing them.
    - rule: rule_identity_become_active
      text: |-
        Identity cards become active when the game begins.
  - subsection: rule_inactive_cards
    text: Cards that are {term:inactive} are unable to affect the game or have most of their abilities used.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_default_inactive_card_locations
      text: |-
        Cards are inactive in R&D, HQ, Archives, the heap, the grip, the stack, the Runner's score area, while set aside, and while removed from the game. Facedown cards in the play area are also inactive.
    - rule: rule_inactive_cards_characteristics
      text: |-
        Inactive cards in most zones retain their printed characteristics (name, card type, faction, cost, subtypes, influence, etc). Facedown installed Runner cards have no characteristics.
  - rule: rule_card_draw
    text: |-
      For a player to {term:draw} 1 or more cards is to take that many cards from the top of their deck and put them into their hand. {ref:Sec_drawing_cards} provides more details about drawing cards.
  - rule: rule_inactive_ability_exception_link
    text: |-
      Most abilities are active if and only if the card they appear on is active. {ref:Sec_inactive_ability_exceptions} details the cases where abilities on inactive cards are still active.
  - rule: rule_card_conversion
    text: |-
      Abilities can convert cards from one type into another type, or even from a card into a counter. {ref:Rule_add_card_to_score_area,rule_card_to_counter} explain the details of card conversion.

- section: sec_counters_and_tokens
  text: Counters and Tokens
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_counters_cards
    text: |-
      {term:Counters} and {term:tokens} are game pieces (or equivalent) that track various resources, effects, and statuses of players and their cards.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_counter_token
      text: The terms "counter" and "token" are interchangeable.
  - subsection: rule_bank
    text: |-
      The {term:bank} is the supply of counters not yet in play. Counters in the bank are available to both players to take and use as dictated by the game rules and card abilities. Players do not control counters in the bank and cannot spend them. The bank is an unlimited supply; running out of game pieces to track a type of counter does not prohibit a player from gaining counters of that type or placing them on cards.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_bank_default
      text: If an instruction directs players to place counters on a card without designating where those counters come from, take those counters from the bank.
    - rule: rule_counters_placed_condition
      text: A condition or restriction that looks for counters being placed on a card can be met by either counters from the bank or counters moved from another location.
  - rule: rule_card_conversion_game_piece
    text: |-
      Some abilities can convert a card into a counter. A counter put into play in this way is tracked with the card acting as a game piece. See {ref:rule_card_to_counter}.
  - rule: rule_additional_counters
    text: |-
      Some abilities can cause a player or card to have or be "considered to have" 1 or more counters or additional counters without placing or giving those counters. A counter considered to exist in this way conveys all the same information and effects as a counter of the specified type would, except that it cannot be moved or removed from the card or player it belongs to, nor can it be spent to pay a cost.
  - subsection: rule_counter_types
    text: |-
      There are ten types of counters: credit counters, click counters, tag counters, bad publicity counters, core damage counters, advancement counters, virus counters, power counters, agenda counters, and condition counters.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_type_credit_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Credit counters} are used to track the number of credits each player has in their credit pool; they can also be placed on cards. Rules for credits, the credit pool, and other related concepts are in {ref:sec_credits}.
    - rule: rule_type_click_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Click counters} are a gameplay aid used to track the clicks the active player has spent or has left to spend during their turn. Rules for clicks are in {ref:sec_clicks}.
    - rule: rule_type_tag_counter

    - rule: rule_type_bad_pub_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Bad publicity counters} represent bad publicity the Corp has earned. Rules for bad publicity are in {ref:sec_bad_publicity}.
    - rule: rule_type_core_damage_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Core damage counters} are a gameplay aid used to track core damage the Runner has suffered. Each point of core damage the Runner suffers forces them to take a core damage counter. See {ref:sec_damage}.
    - rule: rule_type_advancement_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Advancement counters} are a counter used primarily on installed agendas to track the Corp's progress toward being able to score them.
    - rule: rule_type_virus_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Virus counters} are a generic counter, used primarily by {subtype:virus} programs, that can be removed by the Corp purging them. See {ref:rule_purge}.
    - rule: rule_type_power_counter
      text: |-
        {term:Power counters} are a generic counter used by a variety of cards. They have no special rules.

        {term:Condition counters} are counters that have rules text. Their abilities are active as long as they are hosted on a card.

- section: sec_credits
  text: Credits
  snippet: |
    Each of the Runner's credits represents enough money to upgrade some basic parts for their console, have a meal at a decent restaurant, or buy a ticket and some concessions for a night at the sensies.
    Each of the Corp's credits represents enough money to manufacture a run of computer parts, buy out a decent restaurant, or film a low-budget sensie.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_credit
    text: |-
      A {term:credit} ({img:credit}) is the basic unit of currency. Players spend their credits to pay for various costs, card abilities, traces, etc. Credit counters most commonly represent 1[c] each, but can represent larger denominations if clearly marked.
  - subsection: rule_sec_recurring
    toc:
    text: Recurring Credits
    rules:
    - rule: rule_recurring_credits
      text: |-
        {term:Recurring Credits} ([recurring]) place credits on a card repeatedly. The text "N[recurring]" means "When this card becomes active, place N credits on it. Before abilities meet their trigger conditions for your turn beginning, if there are fewer than N credits on this card, place credits on it until there are N credits on it."

- section: sec_clicks
  text: Clicks
  snippet: |
    Working a job, making connections, and especially jacking in—everything you do takes time, and it always goes by faster than you think. A click represents an abstract amount of time spent on a particular activity, either several hours all at once or scattered across the day.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_allotted_clicks
    text: |-
      As the first step of a player's turn, they gain an allotted number of clicks to spend during the action phase of that turn. See {ref:chpt_turns} for details about the procedures of player turns.

  text: Objects

- section: sec_host
  text: Host, Hosted and Hosting
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_host_relationship
    text: Any card in an eligible location can act as a host, but a host relationship can only be created or permitted by a card ability.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_implicit_host
      text: |-
        If a card has an ability describing the types and/or numbers of cards it can host, but it does not have an ability that directly hosts cards onto itself, then the card is permitted as an eligible installation destination for the types of cards listed, up to the number specified. A host card is chosen as an installation destination during {ref:rule_steps_installing_destination} of the installation process.
      examples:
        - text: |-
            {card:Off-Campus Apartment} has the ability, "{card:Off-Campus Apartment} can host any number of {subtype:connections}." This means that whenever the Runner installs a {subtype:connection} card, they can choose to install that card into the play area hosted on {card:Off-Campus Apartment} or as normal directly into the play area.

      At the time an instruction resolves, if any of its targets either have become invalid or were not announced, as much of that ability resolves as possible without acting on the unannounced or invalid targets, following {ref:rule_if_able,rule_do_as_much_as_you_can} of the Golden Rules. A target can be invalid because the chosen object or subroutine no longer exists or because the target no longer meets other requirements specified by the targeting ability.

      A {term:nested cost} is a cost appearing within an ability's instructions that must be paid while the ability is resolving in order for some or all of the rest of the effects of that ability to resolve.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_nested_cost_may
      text: |-
        Nested costs are usually written in the format "[player] may [cost] to [instructions]" or "[player] may [cost]. If [you/they] do, [instructions]." If the indicated player pays the indicated cost, the indicated instructions are resolved. Otherwise, that part of the ability is not resolved.
    - rule: rule_nested_cost_unless
      text: |-
        Nested costs can also be written in the format "[instructions] unless [player] [cost]" or "[player] may [cost]. If [you/they] do not, [instructions]." If the indicated player pays the indicated cost, the indicated instructions are not resolved. Otherwise, that instruction is resolved.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          A subroutine reading "End the run unless the Runner pays 1[c]." contains a nested cost. If the Runner chooses to pay 1[c], the subroutine will not end the run.
    - rule: rule_nested_cost_no_may
      text: An ability that reads "If [you/they] do" or "If [you/they] do not" without a preceding "may" does not indicate a nested cost.
    - rule: rule_nested_cost_otherwise
      text: |-
        Some abilities use the word "otherwise" to indicate that different instructions should be resolved depending on whether a nested cost was paid or not. In an ability with a nested cost of a form described in {ref:rule_nested_cost_may}, treat "otherwise" as an "if [you/they] do not" clause attached to the same cost. Conversely, in an ability with a nested cost of a form described in {ref:rule_nested_cost_unless}, treat "otherwise" as an "if [you/they] do" clause attached to the same cost. Note that "otherwise" can also appear in the context of other types of conditions, and does not by itself indicate a nested cost.
